**_ Product Management App _**

Product Management App is a SPA (Single Page Application) built in React that will have the following functionalities:
-Routing (React Router v6)
-Authentication
-Pagination
-Filters & sorting
-Create new product
-Update product
-Delete product
This is a CRUD APP. A CRUD app is a specific type of software application that consists of four basic operations; Create, Read, Update, Delete.
The Product Management application was built using a fake API and it's not going to make any changes in the database.
FakeStoreApi is a free online REST API that you can use whenever you need Pseudo-real data for your e-commerce or shopping website without running any server-side code. It's awesome for teaching purposes, sample codes, tests, etc.
To build the app I have used Ant Design UI Kit.
Also I have used Github Issues (as a Jira story) to organize and created separate branch for each feature.
